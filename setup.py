packages 
    tells Python what package directories (and the Python files they contain) to include. 
find_packages() 
    finds these directories automatically so you donâ€™t have to type them out. 
include_package_data
   is set True To include other files, such as the static and templates directories.
    Python needs another file named MANIFEST.in to tell what this other data is.
